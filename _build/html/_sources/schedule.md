# Detailed Schedule

## Day 1 - Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Working with Data

### Today, we will:

* Download/Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (if needed)
* Start up and navigate `jupyter lab`
* Read, slice, and filter data with `pandas`
* Explore data with `pandas` and `matplotlib`

### Resources

## Day 2 - Building a Regression Model

### Today, we will:

* Read in data
* Explore and clean data
