# ## 2. Various kinds of machine learning
# 
# There are lots of different kinds of machine learning out there. You might only associate ML with the kind of deep neural networks you see discussed by Google. But there are many kinds. Look at the image below:

# See anything that looks familiar? Regression is a whole category and OLS is one kind of machine learning. The diagram above is based on algorithmic approaches but here is another based on the process:

# ## 3. Classification
# 
# Classification represents a group of algorithms that map observations (features) into class labels. We've seen examples of classification before. The Iris data set is an example of mapping a set of observations, 4 features per observation, into one of three class labels, a particular Iris type. It's easy to imagine many applications and there are multiple algorithms focus on the classification task.
# 
# Classification is a **supervised** learning task. One of the principal concerns we have for a classifier is how often it makes mistakes (i.e., false positives and false negatives relative to its true predictions)

# ### 3.1 Making some data
# 
# We spend a lot of time reading in data but sometimes it is easier to generate some data, under our control, and see what we get. To get a better handle on how easy/hard classification might be, we can use the function `make_classification`
# 
# This function is part of the `sklearn` library, which is the standard for machine learning in python, much like `pandas` is the standard for data handling. We have used `statsmodels` in the past, mostly for its improved statistical properties, but `sklearn` is a big, broad, and well maintained library. We will use it a lot during the rest of the class as will you in your data science future.
# 
# Take a look at the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html#sklearn.datasets.make_classification"> make-classification </a> documentation. It has a lot of parts but most are fairly clear:
# 
# - how many samples
# - how many features
# - how many of those features are:
#     - informative
#     - redundant (basically random noise)
#     - repeated (some combo of informative and redundant)
# - number of classes (how many labels)
# 
# It returns two values: an array of shape(n_samples, n_features) and the integer labels (the class they belong to) for each sample.
# 
# You can look at the rest or take defaults.
# 
# Let's start by making a scatter plot of a sample of data with 3 features including 1 that is redundant with only 1 cluster per class (i.e., 1 grouping per labeled class). Because we have 3 features, we should look at scatter plots of each pair of features. Note that we use `c=class_labels` to send `class_labels` to the color attribute, which colorizes different classes.

### ANSWER ###
features, class_labels = make_classification(n_features = 3, n_redundant = 1, n_clusters_per_class=1)

f, axs = plt.subplots(3,1,figsize=(12,12))
plt.subplot(311)
plt.scatter(features[:, 0], features[:, 1], marker = 'o', c = class_labels, ec = 'k')
plt.xlabel('feature 0')
plt.ylabel('feature 1')

plt.subplot(312)
plt.scatter(features[:, 1], features[:, 2], marker = 'o', c = class_labels, ec = 'k')
plt.xlabel('feature 1')
plt.ylabel('feature 2')

plt.subplot(313)
plt.scatter(features[:, 0], features[:, 2], marker = 'o', c = class_labels, ec = 'k')
plt.xlabel('feature 0')
plt.ylabel('feature 2')


# Given your plots (you might run the code a few times), what does a "redundant feature" appear to be?

# ### 3.2 Plot some examples
# 
# Some data are easier to classify than others. You might remember this from the work we did with the iris data set earlier in the semester. As a reminder, we include a plot of the iris data set below along with the classfication of each sample.
# 
# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Iris_dataset_scatterplot.svg/768px-Iris_dataset_scatterplot.svg.png"/>
# 
# Let's plot some examples of made-up data to explore in what way we might find it easier or difficult to classify that data. Please generate:
# 
# - 100 samples (that's the default), 2 features, no redundant features, one informative feature, one cluster per class
# - 100 samples (that's the default), 2 features, no redundant features, **two** informative features, one cluster per class
# - 100 samples (that's the default), 4 features, **two**  redundant features, **two** informative features, one cluster per class
# - 100 samples (that's the default), 4 features, **two**  redundant features, **two** informative features, **two** clusters per class
# 
# Make a scatter plot of these data. For the data with 4 features, you might want to look at different pairs of features before answering the question below.

### ANSWER ###
features1, class_labels1 = make_classification(n_features = 2, n_informative = 1, n_redundant = 0, n_clusters_per_class = 1)
features2, class_labels2 = make_classification(n_features = 2, n_informative = 2, n_redundant = 0, n_clusters_per_class = 1)
features3, class_labels3 = make_classification(n_features = 4, n_informative = 2, n_redundant = 2, n_clusters_per_class = 1)
features4, class_labels4 = make_classification(n_features = 4, n_informative = 2, n_redundant = 2, n_clusters_per_class = 2)


# Given the plots here, which of these would be easiest to classify? Why? You might think back to the iris data set if it helps.

# ## 4. Getting Started with Classification: Logistic Regression
# 
# We will learn a variety of classifiers in this class. We will start with one of the most widely used ones: Logistic Regression. The video below provides a conceptual explanation of the technique.

# Think about a situation where you might want to classify some set of things using logistic regression. What is that set? What are the classes? And what kinds of features would you use to build that model?
