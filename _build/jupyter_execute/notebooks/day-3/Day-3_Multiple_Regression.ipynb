On the other hand, just **changing** the data seems like cheating. We have to work with what we have, and if we have to make changes it would be good to do that programmatically so that it is recorded for others to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)\"> imputation </a> is the statistical replacement of missing/bad data with substitute values. We have that problem here. In the **GNP** column some of the values are set to \" \\* \" indicating missing data. When pandas read in the column the only type that makes sense for both characters and numbers is a string. Therefore it set the type to `object` instead of the expected `int64` or `float64`.\n",

    "#### Using numpy.nan\n",
    "\n",
    "For better or worse, pandas assumes that \"bad values\" are marked in the data as numpy **NaN**. NaN is short for \"Not a Number\". If they are so marked we have access to some of the imputation methods, replacing NaN with various values (mean, median, specific value, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to do this:\n",
    "1. you can do a `.replace` on the column using a dictionary of {value to replace : new value, ...} pairs. Remember to save the result. This leaves you with changing the column type using `.astype` but you will have convert to a float, perhaps `\"float64\"` would be good. You cannot convert a `np.nan` to an integer but you can to a float.\n",
