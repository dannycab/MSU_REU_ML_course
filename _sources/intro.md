# 2021 MSU REU Short Course on Machine Learning

Welcome to the 2021 [Physics and Astronomy REU program at Michigan State University](http://pa.msu.edu). We are all excited to have you join us this year!

This short course will focus on the essential aspects of machine learning that are likely to feature in a variety of research areas that you might interact with. From astrophysics to nuclear physics to physics education, many researchers are using the tools of machine learning to gain insight into essential problems in physics.

## Connecting to the class

* We will meet on Thursdays from 2-4pm on Zoom ([Connect now](https://msu.zoom.us/j/93771741855)).
* [Contact Danny](mailto:caball14@msu.edu) for the password to join.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this six week short course, you should be able to:

* Read data into a pandas DataFrame
* Clean data and impute data (as needed)
* Plot data and propose potential models for analysis
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Build classification and regression models
* Evaluate the quality of fitted models

## Organization of the Course

The course will be conducted over the next six weeks. We will meet virtually via Zoom from 2-4pm EDT. The course will make use of Jupyter notebooks, so you will need to make sure that you have installed the [Anaconda distribution of Python with Jupyter](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or something equivalent. The course is broken down into 6 topics:

1. May 27th - [Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Working with Data](./notebooks/day-1/Day-1_Exploring-data-with-Pandas.ipynb) (instructor: DC)
2. June 3rd - [Building a Regression Model](notebooks/day-2/Day-2_Multiple_Regression.ipynb) (instructor: DC)
3. June 10th - Building a Classification Model (instructor: DC)
4. June 17th - Using A Multiplicity of Models (instructor: DC)
5. June 24th - Advanced topics 1 (instructor: JB)
6. July 1st - Advanced topics 2 (instructor: JK)
