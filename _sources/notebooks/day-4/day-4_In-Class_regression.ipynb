    "The process of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)\"> imputation </a> is the statistical replacement of missing/bad data with substitute values. We have that problem here. In the **GNP** column some of the values are set to \" \\* \" indicating missing data.

You cannot convert a `np.nan` to an integer but you can to a float.\n",
