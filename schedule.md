# Detailed Schedule

## Day 1 - Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, Working with Data

### Today, we will:

* Download/Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (if needed)
* Start up and navigate `jupyter lab`
* Read, slice, and filter data with `pandas`
* Explore data with `pandas` and `matplotlib`

### Resources

* [Getting started with `pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/)
* [`pandas` documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide)
* [Getting started with `matplotlib`](https://towardsdatascience.com/matplotlib-tutorial-learn-basics-of-pythons-powerful-plotting-library-b5d1b8f67596)

### Materials

* [Day 1 notebook - Getting Started](./notebooks/day-1/Day-1_Getting-Started-with-Pandas.ipynb)
* [Day 1 notebook - Exploring Data](./notebooks/day-1/Day-1_Exploring-data-with-Pandas.ipynb)

<!-- ## Day 2 - Building a Regression Model

### Today, we will:

* Read in data
* Explore and clean data
* Discuss and plan a regression problem
* Use `scikit-learn` to build a regression model
* Evaluate the fit of the model

### Resources

* [Day 2 notebook - Multiple Regression](./notebooks/day-2/Day-2_Multiple_Regression.ipynb)

## Day 3 - Building a Classification Model

### Today, we will:

* Read in data
* Explore, clean, and transform data
* Discuss and plan a classification problem
* Use `scikit-learn` to build a classification model
* Evaluate the fit of the model

### Materials

* [Day 3 notebook - Getting Started](./notebooks/day-3/day-3_Getting_Started_with_Classification_Models.ipynb)
* [Day 3 notebook - KNN](./notebooks/day-3/day-3_KNN_classification.ipynb)

## Day 4 - Using A Multiplicity of Models

### Today, we will:

* Construct data sets
* Tune parameters to achieve different fits
* Gain confidence in models through cross validation/Monte Carlo validation
* Discuss other models that fit into the `scikit-learn` framework

### Materials

* [Day 4 notebook - What is Tuning and Validation?](./notebooks/day-4/Day_4-What_is_Tuning_and_Validation.ipynb)
